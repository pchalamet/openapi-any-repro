## Bug Description: OpenAPI 'any' Type Issue

### Summary
This repository demonstrates a bug related to OpenAPI schema generation leading to any in schema definition.

### Details

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Build Api.
2. The output OpenAPI schema is written to [`Api/Api.json`](Api/Api.json).
3. Observe in `Api.json` that models referencing `Ref` (such as `RefProfile` and `RefProfile2`) have `any` types in the schema.
	- In particular, the `user` property of `RefProfile2` is typed as `any` in the OpenAPI output, which is incorrect.


### Location
- File: [`Api/Models/Ref.cs`](Api/Models/Ref.cs)
- Line: `public required string Id { get; init; }`
- OpenAPI Output: [`Api/Api.json`](Api/Api.json) (generated by `Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server`)
