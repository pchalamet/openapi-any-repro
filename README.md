## Bug Description: OpenAPI 'any' Type Issue

### Summary
This repository demonstrates a bug related to OpenAPI schema generation leading to any in schema definition.

### Details

The file [`Api/Models/Ref.cs`](Api/Models/Ref.cs) contains the following code:

```csharp
namespace Api.Models;

public record Ref {
	// BUG: Remove this line and openapi is ok.
	//      Keep the line and openapi contains any (see Profile and Profile2).
	public required string Id { get; init; }
}
```

- If the property `Id` is **present**, the generated OpenAPI schema contains `any` types for models that reference `Ref` (see `RefProfile` and `RefProfile2`).
- If you **remove** the property, the OpenAPI schema is generated correctly.


### Steps to Reproduce
1. Keep the property `Id` in `Ref.cs` and generate the OpenAPI schema using the `Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server` package.
2. The output OpenAPI schema is written to [`Api/Api.json`](Api/Api.json).
3. Observe in `Api.json` that models referencing `Ref` (such as `RefProfile` and `RefProfile2`) have `any` types in the schema.
	- In particular, the `user` property of `RefProfile2` is typed as `any` in the OpenAPI output, which is incorrect.
4. Remove the property `Id` and regenerate the OpenAPI schema.
5. The schema in `Api.json` is now correct.


### Location
- File: [`Api/Models/Ref.cs`](Api/Models/Ref.cs)
- Line: `public required string Id { get; init; }`
- OpenAPI Output: [`Api/Api.json`](Api/Api.json) (generated by `Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server`)
